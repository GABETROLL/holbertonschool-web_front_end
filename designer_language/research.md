In this blog, I choose Regina, one of 3 personas from my Holberton assignment, to create a better UX experience for her, and to learn more about UX.

I chose Regina because she seemed very different from me. I wanted to try and have a break from myself, and try and see things from a different point of view, so that I can be a more un-biased designer.

After looking through her profile, she seems like a very fun person that I would simpathize with very much, like the part where her profile says that she "likes to sing her heart off" in the trucks she's driving. Which is a plus, and I believe this could help me do a better job.

## Opportunities for improving Regina's experience
### Functionality and Features
If searching in the entire Spotify platform is different than searching in your own playlists, there should be different search inputs with clear, visible purpose.

There should be one search bar for each playlist, that way Regina can play multiple songs of the same genre together before switching.

There should be a "sort-by" drop-down that lets Regina sort by year, date added, artist, genre, folder, and maybe more. There should be one for all of her songs and one for each folder. This way. she has the most control.

I think a good GUI lets the user know where to find any feature easily is without shoving all of the options in their face.

I think a good GUI expernience is knowing __where__ everything is, and knowing where to find any feature without having to search for it in the app. I like GUI's to feel more like a menu and less like a maze. And when I see Regina struggle with knowing which searchbar to use, I think...

So, for that reason, I'd make the search feature for the folders only pop up when the folder is clicked on, then have its play, sort-by label and drop-down show up. Also, hide the other search bars for her other saved songs to prevent her from getting confused.

Finally, the most important GUI change: move the ``div``(?) with the home and search icons on top of the whole app, as a header, instead of at the left, that way it's more clear that __that__ search bar searches the entire Spotify paltform. Also, add text on that search bar to say that explicitly, like with something like ``Search Spotify``.
