# Learning CSS With Flexbox

There are two files: ``index.html`` and ``styles.css``.
Each exercise updates these files, and creates a new version of them.
The number at the start of the name of each file (``#-``) represents its version.

## Exercises
0. Make the ``row`` class have ``display: flex``, remove the ``row::after`` selector and remove the ``float: left`` inside ``[class*='col-']``
1. Add classes to each of the sections in ``1-index.html``
2. Add ``flex-direction: row-reverse`` to the ``row`` class inside the ``section-latest-news`` class
3. Join the two ``ul``'s in the services ``section`` into one, then add ``flex-wrap: wrap`` to ``.services-section .row``
4. Change the widths of some rows and columns to use the ``rem`` unit
