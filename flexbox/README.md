# Learning CSS With Flexbox

There are two files: ``index.html`` and ``styles.css``.
Each exercise updates these files, and creates a new version of them.
The number at the start of the name of each file (``#-``) represents its version.

## Exercises
0. Make the ``row`` class have ``display: flex``, remove the ``row::after`` selector and remove the ``float: left`` inside ``[class*='col-']``
1. Add classes to each of the sections in ``1-index.html``
