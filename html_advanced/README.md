# Building a Website with Html
## By Holberton
### Exercises
There are 41 exercises, all of them involve two files: ```index.html``` and ```styleguide.html```. ```index.html``` tries to recreate an actual website, while ```styleguide.html``` showcases different things you can do in HTML. Each file with these names copies from the file with a number lower than it. The files without the nmber are the final result. ENJOY!! GOD BLEE YOU!!!
