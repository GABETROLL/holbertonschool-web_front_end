# Devtools
In this folder, we'll be learning how to use the Chrome DevTools!

Using this site: https://dev-tools.hbtn.info/
And the [FireFox DevTools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/)

Each exercise's answer may be stored in a file starting with the same number.

    (no need to do the first few steps, just right-click on the cake)
6. Right-Click>Inspect the *ABOUT* ``h2``, and go to the ``Computed`` pane. Where is the ``margin-bottom`` style of the "About" header defined?
    Just click on the arrow left of the property. *(It apparently gave me the right answer, but I'm not sure if this is a reliable way to do it. I could find any documentation on this. My apologies)*
7. How many click event listeners are referenced in JavaScript files?
8. What is the HSL format of the *Send!* button's ``background-color``?
    https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/color/
    (scroll down to "Convert colors")
    *(BUT MAKE SURE YOU ROUND IT FIRST)*
9. What is the ``max-width`` of the first ``div`` with class ``container`` in the section with the "ABOUT" ``h2``?

10. Swap the "About" and "Portfolio" ``section``s
    I just dragged the "About" ``section`` tag in the inspect tab over the "Portfolio" ``section`` tag.

13. Select the Avatar image in the header and type $0 in the console. Enter. What does it return?

14. Type ``console.log(document.title)`` in the DevTools console. What does it "print"?
