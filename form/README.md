3. Add ``spans`` inside ``divs`` in the ``fieldset``s in the form, and add a ``Post my comment`` button
4. Add text inputs inside the ``spans``, with their validations, and style them
5. Add validation text help, and use CSS styling to hide it until the ``form-group`` is ``focused-within``

7. Add search bar ``form`` in the ``nav``, and style the search ``input`` to: disapear when not focused, and expand when clicked on; and have the mouse point at it when it's "closed"
