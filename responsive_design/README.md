# Me Learning Responsive Design
``1``: Make banner background have ``background-position: 65% 8rem`` and ``backgorund-size: 90rem auto``, and make ``.section-hero .section-inner`` have ``min-height: 35vh``
``2``: Replace ``width`` with ``max-width`` in the ``.container`` selector
``2-1``: Use ``@media`` queries to make the navbar disappear, make list's directions be vertical, etc., when the browser screen is ``767px`` or less.
